# Cortical Plasticity Lab (CPL) tools

Primarily tools for pre-processing and simple/common analyses used in extracellular electrophysiology. 

## Matlab_Addons

This sub-repository is typically added to the Matlab path for most machines at our lab.
_Note: `CPLtools` assumes that at some point, the end-user adds this entire folder and sub-folders to the Matlab search path._

## MoveData_Isilon

This sub-repository is used for pre-processing and extracting data from Intan or TDT format into Matlab single-channel raw or filtered data files.

## _SD

This sub-repository contains scripts for Spike Detection and automated clustering (which doesn't work very well).
